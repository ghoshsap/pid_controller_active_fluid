# Propotional Integral controller to switch average speed of active fluid sample on demand

PDE solver and dependencies installation: [cuPSS](https://github.com/fcaballerop/cuPSS). <br>


## Description 

- `pid_solver.cpp`: This file initiates integration and control processes starting from an aligned initial condition.

- `pid_solver_1.cpp`: This file initiates integration and control processes from arbitrary initial conditions, allowing for more varied starting points in simulations. Two example initial conditions are provided in the `init` folder.
